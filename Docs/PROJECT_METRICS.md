# Project metrics

What building SOLTest has cost so far. **Generated** by `Tools/Metrics/update_metrics.py` (`Tools\UpdateMetrics.bat`); do not edit by hand. Rule and design: `CLAUDE.md` (Project metrics), [SDD 41](SDDs/41-project-metrics-tracking.md).

Last updated: 2026-11-11. Tracking since 2026-09-27 (13 sessions).

## Subagents by type, model and effort

Effort is the level the agent's messages actually ran at (`default` = none recorded).

## Main contexts by model and effort

The interactive sessions (not counted as agents).

| Model | Effort | Tokens | Notional price |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| claude-sonnet-5 | high | 780.8M | $227 |
| claude-sonnet-5-5 | medium | 336.8M | $170 |
| **Total** | | **1,117.6M** | **$397** |

## Method and caveats

- **Tokens, models, effort, agents** are measured from the Claude Code session transcripts, de-duplicated by message id. Thinking tokens are part of output tokens.
- **Work and answer time** come from the work-timer hook (`~/.claude/work-timer`): work = prompt submitted to stop, plus time while subagents still run; time waiting on the user is paused and counted as answer time only when the reply came within 10 minutes. It is wall-clock, so parallel agents do not multiply it; the separate agent-time row sums them.
- **Estimated time:** these sessions had no timer file, so their work time is estimated from transcript timestamps (gaps over 10 minutes skipped) and their answer time is not known: 82de31ce (0.05 h), 837b91e2 (0.01 h), b57fb320 (0.63 h).
- **Price is notional.** The project runs on a subscription; the figure is tokens at the Claude API list rates cached 2026-10-06 (cache writes 1.25x input for 5 minutes and 2x for 1 hour; cache reads at the model's cache-read rate), applied to every model at today's rates.
- **Persistence.** Per-session numbers are kept in `~/.claude/metrics-ledger/` (outside the repo), so totals do not shrink when Claude Code deletes old transcripts. Sessions from before the ledger existed were scanned from the transcripts that were still on disk.
